DaemonTweety
============

A simple twitter notification daemon

## Introduction
This is a dirty Python script showing your timeline tweets in small dialogs. In every dialog it shows the avatar of who is twetting and it lets you retweet. All the links in tweets are clickable!
It is built with [libnotify](http://www.galago-project.org/news/index.php) and [Python Twitter](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter) 

From here https://dev.twitter.com/apps add it as your application, get the OAuth credentials and fit them in it (at the beginning of the script there are some dedicated variables).
